----------

1. Added support to the new RestApi page:

-Added RestApi page mapped to path '/restApi'.
-Added functional code related RestApi page.
-Added FilterSiteUsage9 (page logging) support for RestApi page.

2. Made use of 'UriComponentsBuilder' for constructing URL with path or params:

-The main purpose is to utilize the encode() method to encode the unsupported characters
in the URL. Added this change to the existing code that directly returns URL with parameters
in the MVC controllers. As of now, 'UriComponentBuilder' will be implemented for complex URL.
