Fixed a bug where site logging doesn't work properly for BOT requests:

-Site logging, or being called in this project as 'SiteUsage', is a feature
collecting number of page requested by each user. This feature was initially designed
to work perfectly with normal human behavior. However, this website has been overwhelmed
by spam BOTs which have inhuman behavior. As a result, it broke the site logging system
in some certain circumstances, such as when a BOT accesses a page with a different cookie
but within the same session which results in null data in the database, and when a BOT
requests for unexpected URL which results in BOT detection filter not being triggered.
