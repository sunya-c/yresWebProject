Added @ControllerAdvice class to handle 404 error.

----------

Added @ControllerAdvice class to handle 404 error:

-The class I'm talking about is 'ControllerErrorCenter'. Generally,
@ControllerAdvice class is meant to be the center for error handling.
For now, it can handle only 404 error, as I don't want to rush into
other error codes which I'm not yet familiar with. More error code
handling will be added to this class in the future as neccessary.
