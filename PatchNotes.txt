1. Fixed a bug where certain user inputs caused unexpected behavior:

-Text from user inputs that is included in HTML code is now escaped using HtmlUtils.htmlEscape().


2. Fixed TryMe! on 'Try REST api' page didn't accept HTTPS:

-Updated protocol on sSendRequest controller to accept HTTPS instead of HTTP. This should be done
in v1.61, but I somehow missed it.
