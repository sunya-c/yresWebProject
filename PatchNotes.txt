Added support for the new Server (moving from AWS to THAI DATA CLOUD):

-We're moving to a new server which are much affordable than AWS. As this project has been designed with universal compatibility in mind, the only thing that has to be changed is just the database driver dependency. Since the database on the new server is MariaDB, we replaced the existing MySQL driver dependency with a MariaDB driver dependency.
