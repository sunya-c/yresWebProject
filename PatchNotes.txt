1. Moved large environment variable's values to be stored on database

----------

1. Moved large environment variable's values to database:
-AWS' environment variable feature has a file size limitation, which environment variable's keys
and values altogether couldn't exceed 4096 bytes. To overcome this limitation, the large values
were moved to database, and the values were replaced by a short reference name instead.
