Added support for the new 'domain name' and 'HTTPS certificate'.

----------

Added support for the new 'domain name' and 'HTTPS certificate':

-After using AWS Elastic Beanstalk's default domain name for a long time, our application now has its own domain name!, which is 'y-res.com'.
-Added support for HTTPS protocol. All requests are now managed by load balancer which causes some HTTP header values different from what it used to be, some particular code that relies on these header values has to be changed accordingly.
-Added a filter which redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS URL.
-Added path '/healthcheck' for the application to run correctly on AWS.
-Optimized FilterBot to be more efficient. AWS load balancer brought so many random requests to the application that the free-tier limit of a library FilterBot implementing was reached. Further optimization will be done in the upcoming commit.
