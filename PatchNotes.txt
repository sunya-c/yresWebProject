Fixed 'TryMe!' form not working on AWS server.

----------

Fixed 'TryMe!' form not working on AWS server:

-Initially, 'TryMe!' form on RestApi page sent a real REST request,
with the help of RestTemplate, to the REST controller located within
the same domain name (nested requests). However, it was somehow broken
when running on AWS elastic beanstalk. The cause is still unknown.
I believe it could be either AWS not able to handle nested requests or
some timeout configurations not properly configured. Accordingly, it's
not sending a real REST request anymore, it will internally call the
methods in the REST controller instead.
