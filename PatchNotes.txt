1.SEVERE! Fixed a bug where users visiting the website for the first time encountered an error:
-AWS servers seemed to behave differently comparing to other systems. It somehow just got the
user's request before the JSESSIONID cookie was even created, which resulted in null cookie, which
was the cause of the error preventing users from entering the website. Simply adding a condition
to handle null cookie in CookieManager.java fixed the issue.

2.Simplified codes in FilterAccountExistence.java and FilterLoginState.java:
-Nothing special, just made it less tedious and more readable.

3.Added significant compromise to restrictions for entering ErrorPage.jsp:
-Removed a number of restrictions which used to prevent some error cases to reach ErrorPage.jsp.
