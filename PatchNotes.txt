1. Fixed the improperly-written code which could lead to race condition.
2. Added checking if the request's IP address is in blacklist.

----------

1. Fixed the improperly-written code which could lead to race condition:

-Classes affected: FromServlet, RestrictionsCreateAccount, RestrictionFeedback, DaoLogin, DaoFeedback,
ServiceCreateAccount, ServiceFeedback, ServiceLogin, FilterAccountExistence, FilterBot, FilterLoginState,
SessionManager (see detail in the next bullet point), CookieManager.

-Redesigned session data and SessionManager class, changing the data stored in session to be in object
format (used to be in data's orginal format like boolean or String), which encapsulates those data, making
data more readable and well-structured.

-Moved unneccessary data, which is basically one-time-use data for viewing purpose, to be stored in Model/ModelAndView
instead of session. Classes/Pages affected: CreateAccount, Feedback, Error, Login (Home), Redirecting, and Welcome.



2. Added checking if the request's IP address is in blacklist:

-As we've been collecting BOT IP addresses for a while, we now have a decent amount of BOT IP addresses.
Those IP addresses can be used as a mini blacklist for preliminary filtering before it entering the core API
for BOT filtering which has a limited number of usage for free tier.
