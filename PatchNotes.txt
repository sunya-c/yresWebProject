Added a workaround for servlet filters not working correctly on AWS

----------

Added a workaround for servlet filters not working correctly on AWS:
-Annotation-based filter configurations seemed to not work correctly on AWS.
The cause is expected to be AWS messing up with its own scheduling, which
causes the server to run filters in an incorrect order. The workaround is to
configure the filter mapping and its order in the web.xml file.
