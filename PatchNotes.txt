Converted more reusable classes to Spring beans.

----------

Converted more reusable classes to Spring beans:
-Converted 'FilterSiteUsage' and 'PojoPersonalInformation' to Spring bean
classes. These two classes are reused infinitely over the application's life
but still aren't managed by Spring. As Spring boot has just been 100% implemented
into this project in the previous commit, this should be a good time to convert
these two leftover classes to Spring bean classes.
