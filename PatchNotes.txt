Fixed when accessing FeedbackPage by the button on ErrorPage, error message isn't pre-typed on FeedbackPage:
-In ErrorPage.jsp, changed variable 'errorDescription' to 'dataError.errorDescription'. This should've been done in v1.4 when overhauling the session data structure, but I somehow missed this one.
