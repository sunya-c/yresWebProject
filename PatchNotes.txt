1.Added request's IP address tracking to identify suspicious spam requests:
-Recently, there's an increasing number of requests which are suspected to be bots.
This particular update was added to take a deeper look into the identity of those
suspicious requests. The update that prevents bots from entering the website will be
rolled out soon when I see the common behavior which differentiates normal requests
from spam requests.
