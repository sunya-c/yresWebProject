----------

1.Fixed a bug which environment variables on AWS are inaccessible:
-AWS elastic beanstalk treats environment variables differently from other platforms.
To make them accessible from Java web app, use "System.getProperty()" instead of "System.getenv()".
-Added a few lines of code to automatically run either "System.getProperty()" or "System.getenv()"
depending on which one available.

2.Added database connection to store feedback from users:
-Added DaoFeedback.java as a JDBC connection class.
-Updated ServletFeedback.java to pass feedback infomation to DaoFeedback.java.

3.Updated SessionManager.java class to control a larger portion of the session:
-Updated SessionManager to have finer control over a session, allowing a group of attributes to be
removed at once.

4.Updated webpage decorations and added Github link to the Home page:
-Added important note area at the top of home page.
-Added Github link for the website's source code to Home page.
-Added certificates to Personal Information page.
