Changed the packaging from JAR to WAR (.jsp somehow only works with WAR):
-I don't know why it throws 404 page not found (only for .jsp, .html works fine) when
packaging as JAR. Took me 3 whole days to figure this out. JAR somehow doesn't support
.jsp file no matter what. The only approach is to go for WAR, the embedded tomcat is
still available, though.
